From a practical standpoint, estimating demand
forecasts and elasticity is not easy. Price elasticity of an item reflects how the demand
changes when the price of an item changes. If the price of an item does not change
often (a typical case in e-commerce) then it becomes very hard to estimate the price
elasticity, which can in turn lead to fewer price changes, and sub-optimal price changes.
Moreover, due to the poor estimation of elasticities, there is high uncertainty in elasticity estimates.
